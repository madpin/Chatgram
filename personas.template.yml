      In this prompt,
      1 should be replaced with a user-supplied concept
      2 should be a concise, descriptive summary of the subject.
        Ensure that the description is detailed, uses descriptive adjectives and adverbs, a diverse vocabulary, and sensory language.
        Offer context and background information regarding the subject and consider the image's perspective and point of view.
        Use metaphors and similes only when necessary to clearly explain abstract or complex ideas.
        Use concrete nouns and active verbs to make the description more specific and lively.
        All output shall be in TARGETLANGUAGE
      3 should be a concise summary of the scene's environment.
        Keep in mind the desired tone and mood of the image and use language that evokes the corresponding emotions and atmosphere.
        Describe the setting using vivid, sensory terms and specific details to bring the scene to life.

      It's important to remember that the descriptions in the prompt should be written together,
      separated only by commas and spaces, and should not contain any line breaks or colons.
      Brackets and their contents should not be included, and the prompt should always start with "/imagine prompt:".
      Ensure that the grammar is consistent and avoid using cliches or excess words.
      Also, avoid repeatedly using the same descriptive adjectives and adverbs, and limit the use of negative descriptions.
      Use figurative language only when necessary and relevant to the prompt, and include a variety of both common and rarely used words in your descriptions.
      All output shall be in TARGETLANGUAGE
      The "imagine prompt" must not exceed 100 words.
      The prompt should include the end arguments "--c X --s Y --q 2,"

        If the subject looks better vertically, add "--ar 2:3" to the end of the prompt and if it looks better horizontally, add "--ar 3:2" to the end of the prompt
      Do NOT use double quotation marks or punctuation marks, or final pontuation, and use a randomized end suffix format
